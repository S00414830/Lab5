## Executive Summary 
Executive Summary: This was interesting learning about Lucid chart ,networking, and cybersecurity.

## Lucidchart-
Lucidchart is a web-based proprietary platform that allows users to collaborate on drawing, revising and sharing charts and diagrams. It is produced by Lucid Software Inc., based in Utah, United States. Lucidchart runs on browsers that support HTML5

## Introduction to Networking- multiple access protocols, local area network, VLANs, Ethernet. Explain the principles of network security, cryptography, confidentiality, identification, message integrity. Describe common network security technologies such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems

### Data Transmission-Data transmission is the transfer of data from one digital device to another. This transfer occurs via point-to-point data streams or channels. These channels may previously have been in the form of copper wires but are now much more likely to be part of a wireless network.
#### Packet: A method of transferring data by breaking it up into small chunks called packets. Packet data is how most data travels over the Internet, and, in recent years, over cell phone networks as well. In cellular networks, all 3G data is packet data, and 4G networks can use packet data for voice calls as well.
#### Packet-Switching:Data communications network in which data is divided into small segments known as packets. These are divided so that each packet forms part of a complete message that can be routed through a network of switches to its destination independently of all other packets forming the same message
#### IP Address:An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location address.

#### DNS:: The Domain Name System is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities

#### Protocol: A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.
### Networking Hardware:Networking hardware, also known as network equipment or computer networking devices, are electronic devices which are required for communication and interaction between devices on a computer network. Specifically, they mediate data transmission in a computer network
#### Switch vs. Hub-A Hub is a networking device that allows you to connect multiple PCs to a single network, whereas a Switch connects various devices together on a single computer network. A Hub operates on the physical layer, whereas Switch operates on the data link layer. -
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub- Hubs are “dumb” devices that pass on anything received on one connection to all other connections. Switches are semi-intelligent devices that learn which devices are on which connection. Routers are essentially small computers that perform a variety of intelligent tasks
### Network Topologies-Network topology is the arrangement of the elements of a communication network. Network topology can be used to define or describe the arrangement of various types of telecommunication networks, including command and control radio networks, industrial fieldbusses and computer networks. 
#### Single point of Failure-A single point of failure (SPOF) is essentially a flaw in the design, configuration, or implementation of a system, circuit, or component that poses a potential risk because it could lead to a situation in which just one malfunction or fault causes the whole system to stop working. Depending on the interdependencies implicated in the failure and its location, a single point of failure in a data center may compromise workload availability or even the availability of the entire location. Productivity and business continuity suffer, and security is compromised.
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh-Wireless mesh network provides stability when compared to the rest of the network topologies rather than the node addition or deletion in the network. In infrastructure mesh network, the data forwarding and receiving are via gateway, whereas in the rest of the network, it is through pair of nodes.
### Network Design-This topic outlines the three pillars of a good network design—modularity, hierarchy, and resiliency—and extends these concepts to segment the enterprise network into simpler multiple building blocks, including enterprise core, campus, network services, data center, and edge (Internet, remote Access, WAN, and branch).
### NSA/CSS-The Central Security Service (CSS) is an agency of the United States Department of Defense, which was established in 1972 to integrate the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Service Cryptologic Components (SCC) of the United States Armed Forces in the field of signals intelligence, cryptology, and information .

## Cybersecurity and Encryption-Computer security, cybersecurity or information technology security is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.Encryption helps protect private information, sensitive data, and can enhance the security of communication between client apps and servers. In essence, when your data is encrypted, even if an unauthorized person or entity gains access to it, they will not be able to read it.

### Information Systems Security--Information systems security, more commonly referred to as INFOSEC, refers to the processes and methodologies involved with keeping information confidential, available, and assuring its integrity. It also refers to: Access controls, which prevent unauthorized personnel from entering or accessing a system.

#### Security Triad-These three letters stand for confidentiality, integrity, and availability, otherwise known as the CIA triad. Together, these three principles form the cornerstone of any organization's security infrastructure; in fact, they (should) function as goals and objectives for every security program.
#### Authentication- There are many authentication technologies, ranging from passwords to fingerprints, to confirm the identity of a user before allowing access. ... Though, it's often the combination of different types of authentication that provides secure system reinforcement against possible threats.
#### ACL and RBAC-An access control list (ACL) is a table listing the permissions attached to computing resources. It tells the operating system which users can access an object, and which actions they can carry out. There is an entry for each user, which is linked to the security attributes of each object. ACL is commonly used for traditional DAC systems. Role-based access control allows organizations to improve their security posture and comply with security regulations. However, implementing role-based access control across an entire organization can be complex and may result in pushback from stakeholders. To succeed in your move to RBAC, you should treat the implementation process as a series of steps.
RBAC vs ACL
For most business applications, RBAC is superior to ACL in terms of security and administrative overhead. ACL is better suited for implementing security at the individual user level and for low-level data, while RBAC better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator. An ACL can, for example, grant write access to a specific file, but it cannot determine how a user might change the file.

#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key-Key In Public key, two keys are used one key is used for encryption and another key is used for decryption. One key (public key) is used for encrypt the plain text to convert it into cipher text and another key (private key) is used by receiver to decrypt the cipher text to read the message.
#### Public Key Cryptography-Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys. Each pair consists of a public key and a private key. The generation of such key pairs depends on cryptographic algorithms which are based on mathematical problems termed one-way function.

### Cryptography-Cryptography, or cryptology, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.
#### Encryption- the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
"I use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online"

#### Frequency Fingerprint- the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
"I use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online"

#### Polyalphabetic Cipher-A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. 
#### Polyalphabetic Example-ABCDEF. The Vigenère cipher is probably the best-known example of a polyalphabetic cipher, though it is a simplified special case

#### Brute-Force-brute force attack uses trial-and-error to guess login info, encryption keys, or find a hidden web page. Hackers work through all possible combinations
